I am primarily looking to trade both boards for a Frog TKL WKL or similar 75% or TKL. I will also sell them individually or together if a trade is not made. 

1. QK65 r2 [Black Case with White SS Bottom] - $190 Shipped CONUS via USPS Priority Mail
  
  1 - Polycarbonate Plate
  80% - OwlStabs (installed and lubed)
  1 - Wireless PCB 
  1 - Plate Foam (new)
  1 - Plate Foam
  1 - Case Foam
  1 - PE Foam (installed)
  1 - Carrying Case
  1 - USB Cable
  
  
The QK65 was used as my daily keyboard for 3 months. It was cleaned for the listing and will be sold barebones. The PCB is still built with lubed OwlStabs
and PE Sheet. This is such an amazing board, but I prefer the 75% or TKL layout.

2. Zoom65 EE r2 [Navy Case with PVD Mirror Gold Weight] - $230 shipped
  - All original contents included

The Zoom65 is BNIB and was only opened to test functionality of the PCB, which is in working order. The case anodization is remarkable at the price point. 

3. L&F Gamakay Phoenix Silent Linear Switches - These were used for less than 5 days and I will throw them in free with the trade or to the first buyer.
