Switches

How regular and silent switches work:

The switch is made up of a few components; the top and bottom housing, the leaf, spring, and stem. The keycap is attached to the top of the stem and when you type, the stem travels up to 4mm and will contact the bottom housing on the down stroke. Then, it returns contacting the top housing. In traditional switches, the materials used to make these switches have a vital impact on the type feel and sound profile when the stem makes contact and the materials are always top specs to analyze when purchasing switches. In the case for silent switches, the stem has a rubber or soft material that is wrapped around the rails of the stem, padding the contact between the stem and top/bottom housing, giving it the "silent" sound profile. With the added material, the typing feel may feel "squishy" and "padded" and it shortens the travel of the stem (<4mm), which some people hate. So there are other switches out there, some that I personally own, that "silent" the switch without having the added material around the stem, giving the type experience more similar to a traditional, loud switch (which is more firm and noticeable when you press the key). The issue with these is if you are a hard and fast typer, they are not 100% silent all of the time. Not a huge deal breaker because it less than 10% of the time (guesstimate). I will share both types of silent switches and some switches that are not silenced that are cheap and something I would recommend trying out.
